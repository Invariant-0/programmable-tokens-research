# Programmable Tokens by Invariant0

Welcome to Programmable Tokens research by [Invariant0](https://invariant0.com/), the Fresh New Face of Vacuumlabs Auditing.

It is a design research on how to bring programmable on-transfer functionalities to Cardano native tokens. We believe this will help bring exciting new functionalities to Cardano.
