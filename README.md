# Programmable Tokens by Vacuumlabs

Welcome to Programmable Tokens research by [Vacuumlabs Auditing](https://vacuumlabs.com/blockchain/smart-contract-auditing/) team.

It is a design research on how to bring programmable on-transfer functionalities to Cardano native tokens. We believe this will help bring exciting new functionalities to Cardano.
